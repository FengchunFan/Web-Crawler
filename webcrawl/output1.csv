Study: Children as young as 7 suffer effects of discrimination,"A new UC Riverside study finds children are sensitive to and suffer the impacts of discrimination as young as 7 years old.

The study also suggests that a strong sense of ethnic-racial identity is a significant buffer against these negative effects.",https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2018/10/22/study-children-young-7-suffer-effects-discrimination
