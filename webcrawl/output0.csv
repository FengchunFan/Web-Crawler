After two weeks of remote instruction to begin the winter quarter, about 95% of courses are expected to meet in person. This return was predicated on widespread vaccination within our campus community. According to current UCOP guidelines, if at least 90% of on-campus students, faculty, and staff are fully vaccinated, then UCR can operate under the CDC definition of a “fully vaccinated campus.” Our current vaccination rate is nearly 96%, and this document has been developed by the Instructional Continuity Workgroup (ICW) to help instructors prepare for and deliver their in-person courses, assuming this trend continues. ",https://campusreturn.ucr.edu/what-expect-instructors

Introduction to Aquaponics and Hydroponics Course,"<p>The word &quot;hydroponic&quot; comes from Latin and means &quot;working water.&quot;&nbsp; Simply put, it is the art of growing plants without soil.&nbsp; Adding a fish pond to the system makes it &quot;aquaponics.&quot; When most people think of hydroponics, they think of plants grown with their roots suspended directly into water with no growing medium; however, this is just one type of hydroponic gardening. The major benefit of hydroponic and aquaponic gardening systems is that the nutrients are directly available to the plants, when and where they are needed. With conventional soil-based gardening, plants are expected to find available nutrients in the soil--nutrients that are often not present, having been depleted by excessive plantings. Join us to learn about the most common methods and variations of hydroponic gardening, discuss the pros and cons of each, and take home an abundance of great, general information about both hydroponics and aquaponics.</p>",https://extension.ucr.edu/course/13561061
