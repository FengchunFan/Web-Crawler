It’s also home to the California Museum of Photography — the largest photographic center in the western United States that houses the region’s most comprehensive public camera collection.

Literary enthusiasts will delight in UCR’s annual Writers Week, the longest-running, free literary event in California.

Our interdisciplinary Center for Ideas and Society provides fellowships, research workshops, and public events to strengthen the intellectual and creative life of the university and, by extension, the Riverside community and beyond. The Riverside community also benefits from our Gluck Fellows Program of the Arts, which provides free arts outreach experiences to schools, eldercare homes, museums, and libraries in the most underserved areas of our city. 

Music and movement abound at our year-round concerts, events, and outdoor music festivals, including showcases by our Department of Dance.

What to Expect - Instructors,"Guidance for In-person Instruction at UC Riverside for 2021-22 Background UCR returned to primarily in-person instruction in fall 2021, with more than 80% of our courses meeting in person. After two weeks of remote instruction to begin the winter quarter, about 95% of courses are expected to meet in person. This return was predicated on widespread vaccination within our campus community. According to current UCOP guidelines, if at least 90% of on-campus students, faculty, and staff are fully vaccinated, then UCR can operate under the CDC definition of a “fully vaccinated campus.” Our current vaccination rate is nearly 96%, and this document has been developed by the Instructional Continuity Workgroup (ICW) to help instructors prepare for and deliver their in-person courses, assuming this trend continues. ",https://campusreturn.ucr.edu/what-expect-instructors

Sharing Data,"Permissions It is useful to share data and results with other users on the cluster, and we encourage collaboration. The easiest way to share a file is to place it in a location that both users can access. Then the second user can simply copy it to a location of their choice. However, this requires that the file permissions permit the second user to read the file. Basic file permissions on Linux and other Unix like systems are composed of three groups: owner, group, and other.",https://hpcc.ucr.edu/manuals/hpc_cluster/sharing/
UC Riverside helps secure the future of food,"If you’re eating fruits, nuts, grains, or vegetables in a few years, you’ll likely owe a debt of gratitude to UC Riverside. The university has created a program to transition today’s undergraduates into professional scientists solving tomorrow’s farming challenges. The program, called Plants-3D, will train students to discover, design, and deploy biology and engineering solutions to the projected problem of massive-scale food insecurity due to climate change. ",https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2019/10/15/uc-riverside-helps-secure-future-food

VSCode Usage on HPCC,"Using VSCode on the Cluster VSCode is a code editor that can run locally on your computer, or while connected to the cluster.
When using VSCode on the cluster, please attempt to not use Remote SSH, as it will launch the code server on a head node, possibly creating resource conflicts if many users are doing it at once.
Instead, we can use a feature of VSCode: tunnels.
Setting up VSCode Tunnels Using a tunnel allows us to work on a compute node, rather than on a head node.",https://hpcc.ucr.edu/manuals/hpc_cluster/selected_software/vscode/

Introduction to HPCC Cluster and Linux,"HPCC Cluster Overview The HPCC Cluster (formerly called biocluster) is a shared research computing system available at UCR. The HPCC website is available here.
What Is a Computer Cluster?   A computer cluster is an assembly of CPU units, so called computer nodes that work together to perform many computations in parallel. To achieve this, an internal network (e.g. Infiniband interconnect) connects the nodes to a larger unit, while a head node controls the load and traffic across the entire system.",/tutorials/linux/linux/
