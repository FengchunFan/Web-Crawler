You and I didn't cause this. Then why do we feel we should be doing something more - and what do we do with that anxiety?

Fischer's ruminations on near-death experiences have been consumed by millions in his writings and on YouTube videos.",https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2022/04/13/what-your-moral-responsibility-ukraine
