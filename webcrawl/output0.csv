It would generate between $3.5 to $5 billion annually by taxing the personal incomes of 35,000, or .2% of Californians who account for 30% of the state’s taxable income.

Liking another group doesn't mean you dislike your own,"More than 70 years ago, a pair of psychologists conducted a study in which they asked young Black girls to choose between Black and white dolls. The girls overwhelmingly chose white dolls, ascribing positive attributes to them. The Black girls’ choices and reasoning were interpreted by study authors to indicate “a feeling of inferiority among African-American children and damaged... self-esteem.” The die was cast in psychology discourse: If you like a group to which you don’t belong — an “outgroup” — it’s because you have bad feelings about your own group — your “ingroup.”",https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2022/09/29/liking-another-group-doesnt-mean-you-dislike-your-own
